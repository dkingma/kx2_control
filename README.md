# kx2_control
I wrote Python scripts for both the PC and the Mac that change the ELecraft KX2 time to the current PC/Mac clock in UTC. As noted in the source files, the serial number may need changing as I only had one FTDI cable and one KX2 to try it out on. An FTDI driver needs to be loaded onto your PC before the serial port will be recognized. The driver is located at http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm.

Assuming the serial number does not need changed for a different radio/FTDI combination, I uploaded a compiled executable for the PC.
